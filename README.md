# FunWithArrays
This project was used to expose myself to manipulating arrays without using static methods

Hi, my name is Noe Rivera Jr. and in this project, we were introduced to manipulating arrays without using static methods. We learned how to utilize loops to be able to iterate through an array, and how to apply critical thinking to manipulate arrays in certain situations.
There where 4 methods in the class that contained the manipulating array methods. 

The methods where as follows
1. Printed every value of the array
2. Calculated the value of the average of all values of a interger array
3.
