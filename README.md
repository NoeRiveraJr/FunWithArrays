# FunWithArrays
This project was used to expose myself to manipulating arrays without using static methods

Hi, my name is Noe Rivera Jr. and in this project, we were introduced to manipulating arrays without using static methods. We learned how to utilize loops to be able to iterate through an array, and how to apply critical thinking to manipulate arrays in certain situations.
There are 5 methods in the class that contained the manipulating array methods. 

The methods where as follows
1. Printed every value of the array
2. Calculated the value of the average of all values of a interger array
3. Prints an array backwards
4. This method takes 3 parameters: a string to dictate left or right, int for number of spaces to move, and an array to do this on. It will use these parameters to rotate an array
5. The last method sorts an array from values that are from least to greatest
